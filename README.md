# configure nvim

### Introduction

The neovim configuration leveraged from ['kickstart.nvim'](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/blob/master/README.md)


 If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
 a guide. One possible example:
 - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/


 And then you can explore or search through `:help lua-guide`
 - https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html
